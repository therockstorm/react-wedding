      I had never been to San Francisco, so Rock booked a trip for us the first
      week of November 2018. He has good friends living there he wanted me to
      meet and a long list of his favorite places to show me. The first day, we
      rented a car and he drove us down Highway 1 along the Pacific coast.

      During our travels abroad, our thing was to have a picnic in every city.
      We stopped in Santa Cruz for some IPAs, cheese, meat, and crackers and got
      to Big Sur juuuust before sunset. We drove the bumpy dirt road back to
      Pfeiffer Beach, parked, and walked the sandy paths through the trees. The
      beach is unreal. We plopped down on a blanket, cracked open the beers, and
      cheers'ed. A couple of minutes later Rocky said, "I'm going to ask that
      guy to take our picture."

      I come to find out later Rocky whispered, "Will you take our picture and
      just keep taking them? I'm going to propose to her." The guy was all in to
      capture this moment for us. I was completely shocked, shaking, and so
      happy. We said "thank you" to the guy and as he gave us his
      congratulations, he shared he had gotten married the past Sunday. I looked
      over at his wife smiling and cheering for us. It was the perfect moment.
